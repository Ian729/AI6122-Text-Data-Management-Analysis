1. Time: The quiz duration is 30 minutes, to be conducted within the first hour of the lecture slot (from 6:30 to 7:30). Please note that we have 70+ students, so it is unlikely we are able to start exactly from 6:30. Likely we can start at 6:40 when everyone is ready.

Referring to lecture notes in softcopy (e.g., through an iPad) is NOT allowed. This is to avoid possible communication. You are allowed to use calculator and/or rough paper. The link location of the quiz in NTULearn will be the same folder as the mock quiz when it is released.

3. Questions: The quiz contains True/False questions (1 mark each), MCQ questions (2 marks each), and short answer questions (3 marks each) with a total mark of 30. The questions will appear randomly.  The topics to be covered in the quiz include all the topics till Parsing (i.e., all lectures before the topic of text classification, text classification is not included). The slides on Lucene is not included. 

4. You will need a password to access the quiz. The password will be released through Microsoft Teams, the channel we conduct lectures. Before the quiz start, you must login the Teams with a mobile phone, camera on.
